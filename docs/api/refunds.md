# Refunds

Create refunds to return funds to a customer's payment method. Refunds are always associated with a specific payment.

::: info Partial and Full Refunds
You can issue a **full refund** for the entire payment amount, or a **partial refund** for a lesser amount. Multiple partial refunds can be issued against the same payment, as long as the total refunded does not exceed the original payment amount. The `amount_refunded` field on the payment tracks the cumulative refunded amount.
:::

::: warning QR Ph Payments
QR Ph (`qrph`) payments **do not support refunds**. See [Payment Methods — Refund Support](/guide/payment-methods#refund-support) for details.

::: tip Property Access
Response field names above are shown in `snake_case` (matching the raw API response). In PHP, access them as **camelCase** typed properties on the DTO — e.g., `payment_id` becomes `$refund->paymentId`. See [Response Data](/guide/response-data) for details.

### Refund Statuses

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `succeeded` | The refund was processed successfully and funds have been returned to the customer. |
| `pending` | The refund is being processed. Some refunds may require additional processing time depending on the payment method. Listen for the `refund.updated` webhook to get the final status. |
| `failed` | The refund could not be processed. This may occur if the payment method is no longer valid or the issuer declined the refund. |

## Update a Refund

Update a refund's metadata:

```php
use LegionHQ\LaravelPayrex\Facades\Payrex;

$refund = Payrex::refunds()->update('re_xxxxx', [
    'metadata' => ['ticket_id' => 'SUP-001', 'resolved' => 'true'],
]);
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "id": "re_xxxxx",
    "resource": "refund",
